# My Portfolio

## Overview
This is my portfolio website for getting info about me, including how to contact me, and seeing what sort of software projects I've created and worked on. 

## Features
Standard portfolio features: About Me (with contact info), Work Experience and Projects. It was built using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I wanted to keep it simple for this one.
