History
Original build with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and JavaScript

Current Fixes in progress:
-Create classes (or maybe modules with functions to retun the html string) out of the HTML
 that creates the HTML string of 1 object (product cards, challenge cards, experience section, lead section)
 No: not much gain, just a change of verbiage in it's implementation, but not as clean as the current function,
 because I'd have to create a constructor for each object and I never have to work with the values again after 
 object creation, so no need to hold them in a class. If it was a product in an ecommerce site, it's make more sense to 
 make a class becuase I'd be reusing the info in many functions across multiple aspects of the site (sending DB updates, in other
 Views, etc)
-Experience: New background color for sections; Determine col collapses;
-Fix nav toggle position to always right
-Focus bootsrap.css into profile.css
-favicon
-<!-- lodash, underscore.js, fullpage.js, sass, auth0  -->

Planned Changes:
-Convert to React?
-Add Challenges section
-Overall theme change, possibly involving a paralaxing starfield background
