          <p class="m-0">Following my last SDE position my family was hit with a series of issues we needed to attend to. I decided to take a bit of a break to refresh and possibly change my development focus. Then COVID happened and I became the primary caregiver for our son while my wife was able to continue working when allowed. I did explore game development during this time, mostly with Unity and Unreal Engine. As school has gone back to in person instruction Iâ€™ve had the time to focus on getting my skills back to where they need to be and start looking for a new position.</p>
