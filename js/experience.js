Then COVID happened and I became the primary caregiver for our son while my wife was able to continue working when allowed. I did explore game development during this time, mostly with Unity and Unreal Engine. As school has gone back to in person instruction Iâ€™ve had the time to focus on getting my skills back to where they need to be and start looking for a new position."
